# Audiobooks-Business-Case

Given data from an Audiobook App.
Here, we have a .csv summarizing the data. There are several variables: Customer ID, Book length in mins_avg (average of all purchases), Book length in minutes_sum (sum of all purchases), Price Paid_avg (average of all purchases), Price paid_sum (sum of all purchases), Review (a Boolean variable), Review (out of 10), Total minutes listened, Completion (from 0 to 1), Support requests (number), and Last visited minus purchase date (in days).

## Action Plan :
1. Preprocess the data set :
  1.1 Balance the dataset.
  1.2 Divide the dataset in training, validation and testing data.
  1.3 Save the data in a tensor friendly format (.npz)
  
2. Create the machine algorithm
